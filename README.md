# Snowflake Email Check Extension
This Cognigy Extension checks if an email address exists in the Snowflake `CUSTOMER` table from the sample dataset (`PTCDS_SF100TCL.TPCDS_SF100TCL.CUSTOMER`).

The `Check Email in Snowflake` node takes an email address as input and returns:

- `isMatch` = `true` if the email exists
- `isMatch` = `false` otherwise
